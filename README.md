# Myopia Clusters

In this assignment, I fit the Myopia data to a model and used clustering algorithms to place data into groups. I then created a visualization that shares my findings. 


###Repo Breakdown 

This repository includes the Myopia data (CSV file), a jupyter notebook titled "unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge" which holds the activity, and a PDF of the grading rubric of this assignment. 


###Activity Breakdown 

This activity is broken down into four parts: 


### Part 1: Preparing the Data



### Part 2: Dimensionality Reduction

TSNE reduced the dimensions in the myopia dataset from 10 to 2.  There are not distinct clusters in the visualization of the transformed features using TSNE. 


### Part 3: Cluster Analysis with K-means



### Part 4: Recommendation

Based on my K-means analysis, patients can be clustered into 3 groups. This number was ananlyzed by the Elbow curve generated.
